== Cards Again ==

Each suit is based on an interchangeable part. You're dealt, say, 7 cards. You can play one of each suit, or all of the same suit. The cards have values (1, 2, or 3). If you play all of the same suit, add them together. If you play each of different suits, multiply them.

Could involve deck building.

%% You will have a target number to reach, usually between 1 and 20. You do not have to reach it with a single roll. Everytime you roll, you build a toiling total. When your toiling total _exceeds_ your target number, you succeed. The number you succeed by might be relavent.
