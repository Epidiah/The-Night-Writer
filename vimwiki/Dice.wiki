= How We Roll =

We're going to use d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12.

You will have a target number to reach, usually between 1 and 20. You do not have to reach it with a single roll. Everytime you roll, you build a toiling total. When your toiling total _exceeds_ your target number, you succeed. The number you succeed by might be relavent.
