= History of the Intergalaxians = 
    - *Late 70s* launch of the Intergalaxian toy line
    - *Early 80s* first comic book series
    - *Late Early 80s* a short-lived Saturday morning cartoon
    - *Late 90s* edgy second comic book series
    - *Mid 00s* pastel cartoon reboot that offends the delicate sensibilities of regressive "fans"
    - *Early 20s* the first Intergalaxian tabletop role-playing game

= Previously On =
    - [X] An imaginary toy line about interstellar warriors that can swap their various parts
    - [X] A desire to scratch that nostalgia itch in both setting and rules aesthetic
    - [X] Build your Intergalaxians via a card drafting mechanism
    - [X] Perhaps rolling dice to build up totals until you exceed a target number
    - [X] Ready to abandon any of this

= Rules =
    - [[Dice]]

= Original Toy Line =

A giant assortment of random arms, torsos, heads, and lower bodies that can snap together.
    - No moving parts except where each interchangeable attaches.
    - No paint. Each interchangeable is a solid plastic color.
        - Sold in lots of different colors to reuse molds, including glow-in-the-dark and scented interchangeables later on.
    - All interchangeables attach to the torso.

= Intergalaxian Body Composition =

== Head ==
Knowledge, history, experience.

== Torso ==
Value, armor

== Right Arm ==
Skills, prowess

== Left Arm ==
Cunning, ambush

== Lower Body ==
Movement, should always lift with your legs, carry burdens

= Death and Dying =

Intergalaxians cannot die. But they can be blown apart, and their interchangeable parts can be scattered to the five corners of the universe.
