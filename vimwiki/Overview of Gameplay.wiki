= Overview of Gameplay =

There's a GM, or whatever they'll be called.
There's a party of other players. They play Intergalaxians. Roughly one apiece.
You get together at a table or online to play.

Let's say a single session plays out in a couple hours, give or take.

An arc, or adventure plays out in a handful of sessions.

The GM presents a fantastic or wondrous situation or image, and we build from there.

Intergalaxian Players should have plans they bring to the table.

*Idea:* Player writes down something their Intergalaxian wants, is questing for, or needs. Hand that to the player on your left, whatever that means. That player needs to come up with 3, I already don't care for this.


*Better Idea:* DanMaruschak: Like you're playing in the "gritty reboot" version, but your contribution is something you "recall" from the Saturday morning cartoon

Like Motifs, but the person transcribing what you said needs to tag which part of the IP it comes from: Original Toy Line, Original Comic, Original Cartoon, Gritty Reboot Comic, Glittery Reboot Cartoon.
