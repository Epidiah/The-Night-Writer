# The Night Writer

This an experiment in publicly designing a tabletop role-playing game from scratch. You can watch this mess unfold in real time:

Right now, we're on episode 1 and thus far Eppy struggles to turn on the sound, invents a fictional toy line and the subsequent comic book and cartoon tie-ins, and then awards himself the license for the official role-playing game.

**Please note**, the name Eppy came up with for this fictional toy line off-the-cuff, Starriors, is a little too authentic, what with it being an actual toy line from the 80s. So he'll have to change that, but he doesn't know that yet.
