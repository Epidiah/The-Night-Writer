## Who are You Playing?

You're a Space Intergalaxian, an ageless star knight, lost in a cosmos that has forgotten you and your kind.

You've recently found one another, and an ancient nemesis.

Make characters by assembling the parts you haveâ€”deck building.

Each Intergalaxian looks drastically different from any other.

The interchangeables weren't manufactured, they didn't come off of an assembly line. Some artisans had to carefully craft them. They are great masterworks. They're ornate and each have a distinctive look, the signatures of their creators.

## Interesting Hooks

*Removable Body Parts* Changing the character's capabilities.

Possible classes (like someone who hoards body interchangeables)

    - Interchangeable Hoarder
    - Man-at-arms
    - Interchangeable Scholar
    - Newly Hatched (from their Intergalaxian-torpedo)
    - The Retired Intergalaxian
    - The Lonesome Intergalaxian

## Things I Want

Let's use many colorful dice of different sizes!

Failure is directly related to the limb you're using.

## Interchangeables

### Character Creation

A card drafting game where you pass around available interchangeables. Players pick one they want and pass them on.

Put one in reserve to give to another player.

### First Generation Intergalaxian Toys

    - Wacky Helmets
    - Right arm
        - Weapons and tools
    - Left arm
        - Weapons and tools
    - Torso
        - Wing attachments
        - Power pack
        - Jet pack
    - Lower body
        - Locomotive
        - Scorpion Tails
    - Heart or Heraldry
        - Values, Virtues, Foible
    - Brain
        - Skills, knowledge, sorcery, psionic

    - limbs, including built-in weapons and tools
    - torso?
    - brains, expertise
    - heart, hold your values
    - guts?

The Interchangeables can only be swapped with other Space Intergalaxians.

Some of these Interchangeables have storied histories and almost personalities of their own.

## Things to Do

    - Quest for Interchangeables!
    - Seek out the ancient relics of Space Intergalaxians past.
    - Right old wrongs.
    - Wander the cosmos and helping where you can.
    - Find old lost Space Intergalaxians.
    - The classic Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven/Battle Beyond the Stars situation

## Fighting the Lackawanna

     - Hunted by other Intergalaxians for your parts
     - Code of Honor compeling you to mete out justice
     - Loneliness

## Things to Worry About (and Design Away From)

People are probably going to want to hoard Interchangeables.

## Combat Rules

Focus on avoiding injury and harm instead of inflicting.

# Resolution

By default, all things are possible, if you roll enough points.

Let's say, the standard is a d6.

Roll | Result
1    | Something bad happens, but you learn from it. Next roll, double your result.
2    | Add 2 points
3    | Add 3 points
4    | Add 4 points
5    | Add 5 points
6    | Something over-the-top happens, but you fully succeed regardless of points needed. Something wild happens!

For all dice, 1 is the same, and the highest number is a full success but over-the-top. So the larger the die, the more reliable you are.
## Investigation Rules

TBD.

## Tedium

Some tedium will be good. But we want the prep for it to be interesting and the final result memorable.

# Playing Through the Eras

Set it up so that folks can dial into the era of comic or cartoon they want to play in.

Set schisms between various canon and popular head-canons. Bring fandom into the mix.

Dials for various levels of cartoonish to grim violence.

# GMing

GM role assigned by interchangeable?

Borrowed from Bullwinkle & Rocky: The narrator shifts back and forth between opposing sides. The narrator is emboldened to champion their side in the struggle.

Possibly concurrent stories in different eras of the IP.
