## Who are You Playing?

You're a Space Starrior, an ageless star knight, lost in a cosmos that has forgotten you and your kind.

You've recently found one another, and an ancient nemesis.

Make characters by assembling the parts you haveâ€”deck building.

Each starrior looks drastically different from any other.

The interchangeables weren't manufactured, they didn't come off of an assembly line. Some artisans had to carefully craft them. They are great masterworks. They're ornate and each have a distinctive look, the signatures of their creators.

## Interesting Hooks

*Removable Body Parts* Changing the character's capabilities.

Possible classes (like someone who hoards body interchangeables)

    - Interchangeable Hoarder
    - Man-at-arms
    - Interchangeable Scholar
    - Newly Hatched (from their starrior-torpedo)
    - The Retired Starrior
    - The Long Lonesome Starrior

## Things I Want

Let's use many colorful dice of different sizes!

Failure is directly related to the limb you're using.

## Interchangeables

- limbs, including built-in weapons and tools
- torso?
- brains, expertise
- heart, hold your values
- guts?

The Interchangeables can only be swapped with other Space Starriors.

Some of these Interchangeables have storied histories and almost personalities of their own.

## Things to Do

Quest for Interchangeables!

Seek out the ancient relics of Space Starriors past.

Right old wrongs.

Wander the cosmos and helping where you can.

Find old lost Space Starriors.

## Things to Worry About (and Design Away From)

People are probably going to want to hoard Interchangeables.

## Combat Rules

Focus on avoiding injury and harm instead of inflicting.
