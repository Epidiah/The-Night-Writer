## Drafting

One deck for each attach point.

Shuffle each deck, then cut a number of cards from the top of each deck equal to twice the number of characters you are making. Shuffle all of these into a single drafting deck.

Deal a hand to each player equal to the number of attach points plus 3. The player chooses one card to add to their character (or to trade away when this is all done), then passes their hand to the next player.

This continues until everyone has selected a number of cards equal to the available attach points. Though they might have some mismatches. Place the remaining cards in front of you and now you can start trading.
